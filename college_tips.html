<h1>Kevin's College Tips</h1>
</center>

<h2>* General *</h2>

G1. College is not high school.  You are paying to be there.  Your primary job as a college student is to LEARN.  No one is going to hold your hand and your professors will not hesitate to fail you if you don't do your work.<br> 
<br>
G2. If you bring home good grades, parents are much more likely to be lenient in other aspects of life.<br>
<br>
G3. Try new things.  There are classes, clubs, and organizations devoted to just about everything.<br>

<h2>* Academic *</h2>

A1. Don't take more than 16 credit hours during your first semester.  Taking one fewer class will make it easier to adjust to college life by giving you more free time.<br>
<br>
A2. Finals are much more significant than they are in high school (usually 20-30% of your grade).  Do yourself a favor by working hard all semester, and you'll have a much more relaxing finals week.<br>
<br>
A3. Don't plagiarize.  It's the quickest way to get kicked out of school.<br>
<br>
A4. Be aware of state-dependent learning.  If you always study for a class while drunk, you'd better be drunk for the exam, because you'll have an easier time recalling the info if you're in the same state that you learned it.  A better strategy is to simply study in test-like conditions.<br>
<br>
A5. Get to know your professors (and teaching assistants).  They are valuable resources.  Eventually you'll want them to remember who you are so that they say "yes" when you ask them for a letter of reference.<br>
<br>
A6. Don't be afraid to ask for help.  Free (or cheap) tutoring is usually available.<br>
<br>
A7. Don't be afraid to drop a class early in a semester (before you get penalized).  Sometimes a professor's teaching style is not a good fit for you.<br>

<h2>* Life *</h2>

L1. At some point you'll have the opportunity to drink, and you will.  Learn to drink in moderation and you'll have twice as much fun as the people who are incredibly hungover the next day, and infinitely more fun than the people who can't remember what they did the night before.<br>
<br>
L2. Try not to get too annoyed when people offer you advice on what to do (and not do) while in college.  They're just trying to help you avoid mistakes that they made.<br>
<br>
L3. Do something active every day.  The freshman fifteen is NOT a myth.  The combination of the stress from school, buffet-style cafeterias, and restaurants that deliver until 4am will cause you to gain weight, should you choose to not heed this advice.<br>
<br>
L4. Don't live with friends you can't afford to lose.  Most of the time you can live with friends and it goes really well.  When it doesn't go well, however, it will be horrible.<br>
<br>
L5. The dating pool you'll have in college is likely the largest you will ever see.  Try to take advantage of it.<br>
<br>
L6. Part of your tuition pays for health services like counseling, medical treatment, and a monthly ration of condoms & ibuprofen.  Learn what services are available and use them.<br>
